---

As you advance in competitive debate, you'll encounter specialized terminology that allows for precise, efficient communication. Here are the essential terms every circuit debater should know:

## Basic Terms

**Squo** - Status quo; the current state of affairs  
_"The squo fails to address climate change"_

**T** - Topicality; arguments about whether the affirmative falls within the resolution  
_"We'll go for T in the 2NR"_

**K** - Kritik; philosophical arguments that challenge fundamental assumptions  
_"They're reading a capitalism K"_

**Advantage** - A positive outcome of the affirmative plan in Policy and LD  
_"Our democracy advantage outweighs their econ DA"_

**DA/Disad** - Disadvantage; a negative outcome of the affirmative plan  
_"The politics DA has strong uniqueness"_

## Advanced Circuit Terms

**Apriori** - Prior to; arguments that come before other considerations  
_"This is an apriori issue that determines the entire round"_

**Lay** - Refers to judges with little debate experience, often parents  
_"This is a lay pool, so keep your arguments accessible"_

**Flow** - The detailed notes debaters take during rounds  
_"I'll extend this argument across the flow"_

**Extend** - To continue an argument from one speech to the next  
_"They dropped our solvency defense, so extend that"_

**Drop** - To fail to respond to an argument  
_"They completely dropped our link turn"_

**Kick** - To abandon an argument, usually by the negative  
_"We'll kick the counterplan and go for the K"_

**Collapse** - To focus on fewer arguments in later speeches  
_"We're collapsing to the climate advantage"_

**Crystalize** - To clarify the key issues for judge evaluation  
_"Let me crystalize the round around two key questions"_

## Argument-Specific Terms

**Link** - The connection between the plan and an impact  
_"Their link to the politics DA is non-unique"_

**Internal Link** - Steps in a causal chain  
_"The internal link between recession and war is weak"_

**Impact** - The ultimate consequence of an argument  
_"Nuclear war is the highest magnitude impact"_

**Solvency** - The affirmative's ability to achieve their advantages  
_"They have zero solvency for poverty reduction"_

**Uniqueness** - Why the status quo is different from the post-plan world  
_"Their uniqueness evidence is from 2019"_

**Turn** - An argument that the opponent's logic proves the opposite  
_"We turn their economy argument - regulation helps growth"_

**Permutation (Perm)** - A test of competitiveness, usually against counterplans  
_"Perm: do both the plan and the counterplan"_

## Speech References

**Block** - The 2NC and 1NR (two consecutive negative speeches in Policy)  
_"The block needs to cover all the case arguments"_

**1AR** - First affirmative rebuttal  
_"The 1AR is crucial for answering the block"_

**2NR/2AR** - Final rebuttals  
_"This comes down to the 2NR and 2AR"_

## Strategic Terms

**Concede** - To accept an opponent's argument as true  
_"We'll concede their link but turn the impact"_

**Outweigh** - To prove your impact is more important  
_"Economic growth outweighs on timeframe"_

**Prerequisite** - An argument that must be resolved first  
_"Structural violence is a prerequisite to util"_

**Framework** - The standard for evaluating arguments  
_"Under a deontological framework, consequences don't matter"_

**Meta** - Discussion about the rules or evaluation of debate itself  
_"This is a meta-question about how we should judge theory"_

## Evidence Terms

**Card** - A piece of evidence  
_"That card doesn't say what they claim"_

**Cut** - To select and format evidence from a longer source  
_"We need to cut more uniqueness cards"_

**Tag** - The summary line before reading evidence  
_"That tag doesn't match their evidence"_

**Cite** - Source information for evidence  
_"What's the cite on that impact card?"_

## Theory and Procedural Terms

**Spec** - Specification; demands for more details about the plan  
_"Agent spec is a legitimate theory argument"_

**Vague** - Unclear or insufficiently detailed  
_"Their plan text is too vague to be topical"_

**Abuse** - Unfair advantage gained through rule violations  
_"There's no real abuse from this minor violation"_

**Norm** - Standard practice or expectation in debate  
_"The norm is to specify your agent of action"_

## Using Jargon Effectively

### Do:

- Use precise terminology to communicate efficiently with experienced judges
- Explain jargon when debating before lay judges
- Learn terms gradually through practice and observation

### Don't:

- Use jargon to sound impressive without understanding the concepts
- Assume all judges understand circuit terminology
- Over-complicate simple arguments with unnecessary jargon

## Regional Variations

Different regions may have slightly different terminology or emphasis. When traveling to tournaments:

- Ask local debaters about regional preferences
- Observe successful teams from that area
- Adapt your communication style accordingly

## Continuing Education

Circuit terminology evolves as the activity develops. Stay current by:

- Following debate forums and social media
- Attending camps and workshops
- Learning from successful coaches and debaters

Mastering debate terminology is like learning any specialized language - it takes time and practice, but it becomes second nature with experience.

<Note>
  Remember that jargon should enhance communication, not obscure it. The goal is
  precise, efficient discussion of complex ideas, not showing off your
  vocabulary.
