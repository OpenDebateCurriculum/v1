# Ethos: The Four Ps

Your **ethos** (credibility and character) significantly impacts how judges perceive your arguments. The Four Ps provide a framework for professional presentation in debate rounds.

## 1. Presentability

Your appearance should project professionalism and respect for the activity.

### Do:
- **Wear a suit and tie**: Professional formal attire is standard
- **Choose formal, close-toed footwear**: Dress shoes, not sneakers
- **Wear a belt**: Complete your professional appearance
- **Maintain neat grooming**: Clean, well-organized appearance

### Do NOT:
- **Look disheveled**: Wrinkled clothes, messy hair, or poor hygiene
- **Run into the debate room**: Even if you're late for your round, enter calmly and professionally

## 2. Projection

Command the room with your voice and presence.

### Do:
- **Command the room with your voice**: Show that you care about the debate and the material
- **Make eye contact with the judge**: Adjust to their reactions and engage directly
- **Project confidence**: Speak with authority and conviction
- **Vary your tone**: Match your delivery to the content and importance of arguments

### Do NOT:
- **Mumble**: Unclear speech undermines your credibility
- **Shout**: Aggressive volume is off-putting and unprofessional

## 3. Partnership

In team events, your relationship with your partner affects judge perception.

### Do:
- **Fist bump your partner quietly**: Before or after the round or impressive speeches; exude camaraderie and confidence
- **Support your partner nonverbally**: Positive body language and attention
- **Coordinate effectively**: Smooth transitions and complementary arguments

### Do NOT:
- **Talk to your partner audibly**: About the round before a judge submits their ballot
- **Fight with your partner visibly**: Disagreements should be handled privately
- **Undermine your partner**: Contradicting or dismissing their arguments

## 4. Preparation

Demonstrate respect for the process through organized, efficient behavior.

### Do:
- **Manage prep time professionally**: Use time efficiently and purposefully
- **Be organized**: Have materials ready and accessible
- **Give clear, brief roadmaps**: "Affirmative case, then negative case" is sufficient

### Do NOT:
- **Steal prep time**: Judges will notice and penalize you
- **Give long off-time roadmaps**: Avoid excessive explanation like "First I'm going to talk about... then... next how that interacts with..."
- **Change your roadmap excessively**: Don't deliberate about organization live in front of the judge
- **Give countdowns**: "In 3, 2, 1..." before speeches is unnecessary and annoying

## Strategic Impact

The Four Ps create a foundation for persuasive communication:

- **Credibility**: Professional appearance and behavior make judges more receptive to your arguments
- **Authority**: Confident projection establishes your expertise and preparation
- **Teamwork**: Strong partnership demonstrates organizational skills and mutual respect
- **Efficiency**: Good preparation shows respect for everyone's time

## Common Mistakes

### Overdressing vs. Underdressing
- **Overdressing**: Better to be slightly too formal than too casual
- **Underdressing**: Casual attire can signal lack of preparation or respect

### Nervous Habits
- **Fidgeting**: Pen clicking, paper shuffling, or excessive movement
- **Filler words**: "Um," "like," "you know" damage your authority
- **Reading verbatim**: Lack of eye contact and natural delivery

### Time Mismanagement
- **Rushing**: Appearing frantic or disorganized
- **Wasting time**: Inefficient use of prep or speech time
- **Technical difficulties**: Not having materials organized

The Four Ps provide a foundation that allows your arguments to shine. When judges trust your credibility and professionalism, they're more likely to be persuaded by your substantive points.

<Note>
Remember that debate is a formal, academic activity. The standards for professional presentation reflect the seriousness of the intellectual competition.
