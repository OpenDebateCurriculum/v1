We do speaking drills regularly to prepare our voices for tournaments. 2x per week on weeks with no tournaments, every day on weeks with tournaments. Here are some speaking drills you might find helpful:

- Enunciation: contort your mouth as much as possible to say each word
- Watermelon Drill: interlace every word with a "watermelon" or "porcupine" or another mouthful
- Backwards: literally, read an article backwards
- Screaming: scream into a pillow, as loud as you can
- Spreading
  - People read fast to get through more arguments.
  - You do NOT need to spread, but speaking CLEARLY and FAST has its benefits

**Activity**: speaking drills; give an example of GOOD spreading and BAD spreading; spreading drills!
