Effective oral communication is fundamental to debate success. These drills develop the physical and mental skills necessary for clear, rapid, and persuasive speech delivery.

## Fundamental Speaking Skills

### Projection

**Objective**: Ensure judges can hear you clearly throughout the room
**Technique**: Speak from your diaphragm, not your throat
**Practice**: Read aloud while gradually increasing distance from listener

### Enunciation

**Objective**: Make every word distinct and understandable
**Technique**: Exaggerate mouth movements and consonant sounds
**Practice**: Contort your mouth as much as possible when saying each word

### Pace Control

**Objective**: Balance speed with clarity for maximum argument density
**Technique**: Vary speed based on argument importance and judge experience
**Practice**: Read same passage at different speeds while maintaining clarity

## Core Speaking Drills

### Watermelon Drill

**Procedure**: Interlace every word with "watermelon" while reading
**Example**: "Watermelon-climate-watermelon-change-watermelon-threatens..."
**Purpose**: Forces careful enunciation and tongue control
**Time**: 5-10 minutes daily

### Backwards Reading

**Procedure**: Read articles backwards, word by word
**Example**: "Change climate threatens" instead of "threatens climate change"  
**Purpose**: Prevents reliance on context; forces focus on individual word clarity
**Time**: 10 minutes daily

### Tongue Twisters

**Examples**:

- "Red leather, yellow leather" (10x fast)
- "Unique New York" (10x fast)
- "Toy boat" (10x fast)
  **Purpose**: Develops muscle memory for difficult sound combinations
  **Frequency**: Begin each practice session

### Rapid Reading Progression

**Procedure**:

1. Read passage normally
2. Read 10% faster
3. Read 20% faster
4. Continue until clarity breaks down
5. Return to fastest clear speed
   **Purpose**: Finds optimal speed/clarity balance
   **Materials**: Use actual debate evidence

## "Spreading" in Debate

**Spreading** refers to reading very quickly to fit more arguments into limited speech time. While not required, clear and fast delivery provides significant strategic advantages.

### Good Spreading Characteristics

- **Consistent pace**: Steady rhythm throughout
- **Clear enunciation**: Every word understandable
- **Strategic emphasis**: Slow down for key points
- **Breath control**: Proper pausing for comprehension
- **Judge adaptation**: Adjust speed based on judge experience

### Bad Spreading Characteristics

- **Monotone delivery**: No variation in pace or emphasis
- **Unclear consonants**: Words blend together
- **Gasping for breath**: Running out of air mid-sentence
- **No strategic variation**: Same speed for tags and evidence
- **Judge ignorance**: Not adapting to judge preferences

## Delivery Improvement Exercises

### Mirror Practice

**Setup**: Practice speeches in front of mirror
**Focus**: Eye contact, facial expressions, posture
**Benefits**: Identifies distracting mannerisms

### Recording Analysis

**Setup**: Record practice speeches, then review
**Focus**: Pace, clarity, emphasis patterns
**Benefits**: Objective feedback on delivery quality

### Partner Feedback

**Setup**: Practice with teammate providing real-time feedback
**Signals**: Hand gestures for "slow down," "speed up," "unclear"
**Benefits**: Immediate adjustment practice

### Judge Simulation

**Setup**: Practice with different "judge types"

- Experienced: Can handle faster delivery
- Parent/lay: Requires slower, clearer speech
- Flow judge: Wants organized, signposted delivery

## Advanced Techniques

### Strategic Emphasis

**Slow down for**:

- Taglines and claims
- Key statistics and dates
- Impact statements
- Voting issues

**Maintain pace for**:

- Background information
- Less crucial evidence
- Detailed explanations
- Secondary arguments

### Breath Control

**Techniques**:

- Pause at commas and periods
- Take quick breaths during natural breaks
- Don't sacrifice breathing for speed
- Practice diaphragmatic breathing

### Vocal Variety

**Elements to vary**:

- **Volume**: Louder for emphasis, softer for transitions
- **Pitch**: Higher for questions, lower for serious points
- **Pace**: Faster for evidence, slower for analysis
- **Tone**: Match emotional content of arguments

## Presentation Skills

### Professional Appearance

- **Posture**: Stand straight, shoulders back
- **Eye contact**: Look at judges, not just notes
- **Gestures**: Natural hand movements, avoid fidgeting
- **Attire**: Professional dress appropriate for setting

### Room Management

- **Position**: Center yourself relative to judges
- **Movement**: Minimal, purposeful movement only
- **Materials**: Organize papers to minimize shuffling
- **Technology**: Practice with timer, laptop if used

### Confidence Building

- **Preparation**: Know your material thoroughly
- **Practice**: Rehearse until delivery feels natural
- **Positive visualization**: Imagine successful performances
- **Experience**: Regular practice rounds build comfort

## Common Delivery Problems

### Speed-Related Issues

- **Unclear articulation**: Speaking too fast for mouth to keep up
- **Monotone delivery**: No variation in pace or emphasis
- **Breathlessness**: Running out of air frequently
- **Judge confusion**: Not adapting to judge preferences

### Clarity Issues

- **Mumbling**: Poor enunciation of consonants
- **Volume variation**: Inconsistent projection
- **Filler words**: Excessive "um," "uh," "like"
- **Run-on sentences**: No pauses for comprehension

### Presentation Issues

- **Distracting mannerisms**: Fidgeting, pacing, hair-touching
- **Poor eye contact**: Reading directly from notes
- **Inappropriate tone**: Mismatch between content and delivery
- **Disorganization**: Shuffling papers, losing place

## Daily Practice Routine

### 5-Minute Warm-up

1. Tongue twisters (1 minute)
2. Projection exercises (2 minutes)
3. Enunciation drills (2 minutes)

### 10-Minute Skill Building

1. Watermelon drill with evidence (3 minutes)
2. Backwards reading (3 minutes)
3. Speed progression (4 minutes)

### 15-Minute Application

1. Practice speech with focus on one skill
2. Record and review
3. Adjust and repeat

Consistent daily practice with these drills will dramatically improve your speaking effectiveness and competitive success.

<Note>
  Remember that clear communication is always more important than speed. A
  well-delivered, understandable argument at moderate pace beats a fast, unclear
  argument every time.
