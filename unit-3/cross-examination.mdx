Cross-examination represents 20% of every Policy debate round and even more of Public Forum. Judges make decisions based on cross-examination, especially if they are less experienced. Strong cross-ex skills can win rounds and establish your credibility.

## Strategic Objectives

### Information Gathering

Use questions to understand opponent arguments and identify weaknesses:

- **Clarification**: "What exactly does your plan do?"
- **Evidence probing**: "What's your source for that statistic?"
- **Scope testing**: "Does this apply to all countries or just the U.S.?"

### Argument Setup

Use concessions to establish arguments for your later speeches:

- **Establishing links**: "Do you agree that economic recession leads to political instability?"
- **Getting admissions**: "So you're saying your plan has no enforcement mechanism?"
- **Creating contradictions**: "Earlier you said X, but now you're saying Y?"

### Credibility Building

Demonstrate your knowledge and preparation:

- **Informed questions**: Show you understand the topic deeply
- **Respectful tone**: Maintain professionalism even under pressure
- **Clear communication**: Ask precise, well-crafted questions

## Effective Questioning Techniques

### Yes/No Questions

**Advantages**: Maintain control, prevent rambling, force clear positions
**Example**: "Does your plan increase government spending? Yes or no?"

**When opponent evades**: "I'll take that as a yes and move on"

### Open-Ended Questions

**Advantages**: Can reveal detailed information, may lead to admissions
**Risks**: Can lose control, waste time on irrelevant tangents
**Example**: "How exactly does your solvency mechanism work?"

**Use sparingly**: Only when you're confident about the answer direction

### Follow-Up Questions

Build on previous answers to develop argument chains:

1. "Your plan costs $500 billion, correct?"
2. "And that money comes from taxpayers?"
3. "So taxpayers bear the burden if your plan fails?"

### Hypothetical Questions

Test the limits and consistency of opponent arguments:

- **Scenario testing**: "What if unemployment stays high despite your plan?"
- **Extreme cases**: "Would you support this policy even if it caused X?"
- **Comparative analysis**: "Is this better than alternative Y?"

## Strategic Question Types

### Link Questions

Establish connections between opponent arguments and your responses:

- "Does your plan require Congressional approval?"
- "Would this policy affect international trade?"
- "Are there environmental consequences to your approach?"

### Solvency Questions

Challenge whether opponent proposals actually work:

- "Has this been tried before? What were the results?"
- "What prevents the same problems from recurring?"
- "How do you ensure compliance with your requirements?"

### Impact Questions

Test the significance and probability of opponent claims:

- "How likely is this scenario?"
- "What's your evidence for this causal chain?"
- "Have experts actually predicted this outcome?"

## Answering Strategies

### Stay Calm Under Pressure

- **Pause before answering**: Think through implications
- **Ask for clarification**: "Could you repeat the question?"
- **Maintain composure**: Don't get defensive or angry

### Strategic Concessions

Sometimes conceding helps your overall strategy:

- **Minor concessions**: Give ground on unimportant points
- **Conditional answers**: "Yes, but only under these circumstances"
- **Clarifying concessions**: "Yes, and here's why that helps our case"

### Evasion Techniques (Use Sparingly)

- **Reframing**: "The real question is..."
- **Context addition**: "That's true, but you need to understand..."
- **Partial answers**: Address part of the question thoroughly

**Warning**: Obvious evasion damages credibility

## Common Logical Fallacies to Exploit

### Ad Hominem

Attacking the person rather than the argument:

- **Question**: "Are you dismissing this evidence because of who wrote it?"

### False Dichotomy

Presenting only two options when more exist:

- **Question**: "Are there other solutions besides these two?"

### Straw Man

Misrepresenting opponent arguments:

- **Question**: "Is that really what we argued, or are you changing our position?"

### Correlation vs. Causation

Assuming correlation implies causation:

- **Question**: "How do you know X caused Y rather than just happening at the same time?"

### Appeal to Authority

Citing authority outside their expertise:

- **Question**: "What makes this person qualified to speak about economics?"

## Format-Specific Strategies

### Public Forum Crossfire

- **Time pressure**: Questions must be concise and focused
- **Multiple participants**: In Grand Crossfire, manage speaking time strategically
- **Accessibility**: Avoid overly technical questions that confuse lay judges

### Policy Cross-Examination

- **Depth allowed**: Can pursue complex argument chains
- **Speed considerations**: Fast-paced questioning acceptable
- **Technical precision**: Judges expect sophisticated strategic thinking

### Lincoln-Douglas Cross-Examination

- **Philosophical focus**: Questions about values and frameworks
- **Individual responsibility**: No partner to help if you struggle
- **Time management**: Limited time requires strategic prioritization

## Practice Exercises

### Mock Cross-Examination Drill

**Setup**: One student presents 2-minute argument, another cross-examines for 3 minutes
**Focus**: Practicing specific questioning techniques
**Debrief**: What information was gathered? What setups were created?

### Role Reversal

**Setup**: Students switch sides mid-drill to practice both questioning and answering
**Skills**: Develops empathy for both positions and strategic thinking

### Video Analysis

**Activity**: Watch recorded cross-examinations from successful debaters
**Focus**: Identify effective techniques and missed opportunities

## Common Mistakes

### Questioning Mistakes

- **Argument speeches**: Making statements instead of asking questions
- **Rambling questions**: Long, unfocused questions that confuse everyone
- **Obvious questions**: Asking about things already clear from speeches
- **Leading nowhere**: Questions that don't set up arguments or gather useful information

### Answering Mistakes

- **Over-explaining**: Giving opponents ammunition through excessive detail
- **Defensive hostility**: Getting angry or argumentative
- **Obvious lies**: Making claims that are clearly false
- **Conceding everything**: Failing to defend key positions

Cross-examination is both an art and a science. Master these techniques through practice, observation, and strategic thinking.

<Tip>
  Prepare cross-examination questions during prep time. Having a planned line of
  questioning prevents you from wasting time on unfocused questions during the
  actual cross-ex period.
