- The best debaters are very efficient with words
  - No interjections, like "um" or "like"
  - No unnecessary tangents
  - For example, instead of "they say X is up, but actually it's down," you might say "X is down," pause, and then explain

**Activity**: make them cut down a really wordy speech; improv, drills not saying more than what's necessary
