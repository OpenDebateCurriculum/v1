# K Affs + Responses

*[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]*

Kritik affirmatives challenge traditional policy debate frameworks by running philosophical or performance cases that may not defend the resolution in conventional ways.

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Framework arguments against kritik affirmatives
- Topicality strategies and interpretation debates
- Permutation and impact turn strategies
- Performance and narrative evaluation
- Strategic considerations for both sides

For foundational skills, review the earlier units on argumentation, rebuttals, and evidence.
