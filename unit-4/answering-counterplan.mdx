_[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]_

When facing a counterplan, affirmatives must prove that their plan is superior to the negative's alternative. This requires strategic thinking about competitiveness, solvency, and net benefits.

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:

- Permutation strategies and theory
- Solvency deficits and comparative analysis
- Net benefit responses
- Competitiveness challenges
- Theoretical objections to counterplans

For foundational skills, review the earlier units on argumentation, rebuttals, and evidence.
