_[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]_

Beyond topicality and conditionality, debaters use various theory arguments to challenge opponent practices and establish procedural norms.

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:

- Specification arguments (agent, mechanism, funding)
- Definitional challenges and interpretation theory
- Disclosure theory and prep-sharing norms
- Speed and accessibility theory arguments
- Strategic theory deployment and responses

For foundational skills, review the earlier units on argumentation, rebuttals, and evidence.
