# Kritiks

*[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]*

Kritiks ("Ks") challenge the fundamental assumptions, methodology, or discourse of the affirmative case rather than just the policy outcomes.

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Framework arguments and alternative methodologies
- Common kritik types (capitalism, security, biopower)
- Link strategies and impact structures
- Alternative advocacy and solvency
- Strategic deployment in Policy and LD debate

For foundational skills, review the earlier units on argumentation, rebuttals, and evidence.
