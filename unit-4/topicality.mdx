_[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]_

Topicality arguments challenge whether the affirmative plan falls within the bounds of the resolution. This is a crucial strategic tool for negatives and a key defensive skill for affirmatives.

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:

- Standards for topicality evaluation (reasonability vs. competing interpretations)
- Violation structure and evidence requirements
- Affirmative responses and counter-interpretations
- Theory and procedural considerations
- Strategic uses beyond pure theory arguments

For foundational skills, review the earlier units on argumentation, rebuttals, and evidence.
