# Answering Kritiks

*[This section will be expanded with detailed strategies and examples]*

When facing kritiks, affirmatives must defend their methodology while proving that policy action still matters despite philosophical objections.

## Preview of Key Strategies

### Framework 
This round is NOT just a debate about capitalism; you need to weigh the aff against a competitive alt OR you need to determine whether this is a good policy in the status quo OR you need to determine whether the resolution is true

### Permutation
Why not do both? or just the K?

### Offense
Actually, capitalism is GOOD, or security dialogue is GOOD

### Solvency
The K can't solve the aff

### Theory
Conditional Ks are bad

### Alt
Transitioning away from capitalism will cause populist whiplash and wars

### Link
Hey, we're not that capitalist anyways

## Coming Soon

This section will provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Framework arguments for policy evaluation
- Permutation strategies and theory
- Alternative solvency challenges
- Link mitigation and turns
- Impact comparison methodologies
