Framework – this round is NOT just a debate about capitalism; you need to weigh the aff against a competitive alt OR you need to determine whether this is a good policy in the squo OR you need to determine whether the resolution is true  
Perm – why not do both? or just the K?  
Offense – actually, capitalism is GOOD, or security dialogue is GOOD  
Solvency – the K can't solve the aff  
Theory – conditional Ks are bad  
Alt – transitioning away from capitalist will cause populist whiplash and wars  
Link – hey, we're not that capitalist anyways
