## Open Source Philosophy

This guide includes drills and exercises to supplement instruction. We encourage users to create and share derivative materials like video lessons and practice drills. The best contributions will be incorporated back into the main curriculum.

## Practice Formats

Throughout this guide, we'll use modified debate formats for skill development. For example, **Extemporaneous Debate** with shorter speech times allows you to focus on specific skills without the complexity of full tournament rounds.

<Note>
  Don't hesitate to ask coaches or experienced debaters for guidance throughout
  your learning journey. The debate community is built on mentorship and shared
  knowledge.
