All forms of high school debate are fundamentally "competitive speaking." You and your opponent(s) will deliver a series of speeches in front of a judge, who will determine a winner. Tournaments are held on weekends at high schools and universities across the country.

The most popular forms of debate are:

- **Policy Debate:** the oldest and most rigorous form of debate; two debaters per team; each rounds lasts two hours; the affirmative team proposes a "plan;" the negation must prove that this plan is a bad idea.
- **Lincoln-Douglas:** similar to Policy Debate, but 1v1, one-hour long, and more concerned with moral philosophy.
- **Public Forum:** 2v2; each round lasts one hour; neither side really has a "plan"; you instead debate whether a given resolution is true or false.
- **Congressional Debate**: debaters roleplay as policymakers; around fifteen students make speeches in support of or against mock bills (submitted prior to the tournament).

This project will prepare you for all four types of debateâ€”and for any spin-offs you encounter through high school (i.e. Big Questions, Ronald Reagan Debates, World Schools Debate, Parliamentary Debate, etc). It will employ some modified forms of debate (i.e. Extemporaneous Debate) for practice rounds, because their short speech times allow for honing in specific skills.

Please do not hesitate to ask a coach or any older member of your high school's debate team for more information about debate generally or about any of these individual events.
