---

Welcome to competitive debate! You're about to embark on one of the most intellectually rewarding activities in high school. Debate will challenge you to think critically, speak persuasively, and engage with complex ideas across every field of human knowledge.

All forms of high school debate are fundamentally **"competitive speaking."** You and your opponent(s) will deliver a series of speeches in front of a judge, who will determine a winner. Tournaments are held on weekends at high schools and universities across the country.

## What Makes Debate Special

Debate is much more than just winning and losing - it's about:

- **Intellectual growth**: You'll research complex topics and develop nuanced understanding of policy, philosophy, and current events
- **Communication skills**: You'll learn to articulate ideas clearly and persuasively under pressure
- **Critical thinking**: You'll analyze arguments, identify logical fallacies, and construct sound reasoning
- **Research abilities**: You'll learn to find, evaluate, and synthesize information from academic sources

## The Debate Community

One of debate's greatest strengths is its community. Experienced debaters mentor newcomers, coaches share strategies openly, and competitors often become lifelong friends. This collaborative spirit is what makes the activity so enriching.

## The Four Major Formats

### Policy Debate
The oldest and most rigorous form of debate:
- **Format**: Two debaters per team
- **Duration**: Each round lasts two hours
- **Structure**: The affirmative team proposes a detailed "plan"
- **Objective**: The negative must prove that this plan is a bad idea
- **Emphasis**: Deep research, technical argumentation, rapid delivery

### Lincoln-Douglas Debate
- **Format**: 1v1 individual competition
- **Duration**: One-hour rounds
- **Structure**: Similar to Policy but focused on moral philosophy
- **Objective**: Debate philosophical questions about justice, morality, and values
- **Emphasis**: Ethical reasoning, philosophical frameworks

### Public Forum Debate
- **Format**: 2v2 teams
- **Duration**: One-hour rounds  
- **Structure**: Neither side proposes a specific "plan"
- **Objective**: Debate whether a given resolution is true or false
- **Emphasis**: Accessible argumentation, current events, persuasive communication

### Congressional Debate
- **Format**: ~15 students in a legislative chamber
- **Structure**: Debaters roleplay as policymakers
- **Objective**: Make speeches supporting or opposing mock bills
- **Process**: Bills are submitted prior to the tournament
- **Emphasis**: Parliamentary procedure, policy analysis, legislative skills

## Shared Skills

While each format has unique characteristics, they all develop:

- **Research abilities**: Finding and analyzing credible sources
- **Argument construction**: Building logical, evidence-based cases
- **Refutation skills**: Identifying and responding to opposing arguments
- **Public speaking**: Clear, persuasive oral communication
- **Critical thinking**: Evaluating complex policy and philosophical questions

## Format Variations

You may also encounter regional variations and spin-offs:
- **Big Questions**: Philosophical debate format
- **Ronald Reagan Debates**: Values-based competition
- **World Schools Debate**: International parliamentary style
- **Parliamentary Debate**: University-level format with impromptu topics

## Practice Formats

This curriculum will use modified formats for skill development:

### Extemporaneous Debate
- **Purpose**: Skill-building with shorter time constraints
- **Benefit**: Allows focus on specific techniques without full tournament complexity
- **Usage**: Practice rounds throughout this curriculum

## Choosing Your Focus

While this curriculum prepares you for all formats, many debaters specialize in one or two. Consider:
- **Your interests**: Policy vs. philosophy vs. current events
- **Time availability**: Policy requires more research time
- **School program**: What formats does your team compete in?
- **Regional preferences**: What's popular in your area?

## Learning Approach

As you work through this curriculum:

1. **Practice regularly**: Debate skills develop through repetition and application
2. **Seek feedback**: Ask coaches and teammates for specific advice on your performance
3. **Watch others**: Observe successful debaters and learn from their techniques
4. **Stay curious**: The best debaters are voracious learners who engage deeply with ideas

## Building Confidence

Remember that everyone starts as a beginner. Even the most successful debaters lost their first rounds. Focus on improvement rather than immediate success, and celebrate small victories along the way.

## Time Commitment

Debate requires significant time investment:

- **Research**: Preparing for topics and cutting evidence
- **Practice**: Drilling skills and running practice rounds
- **Tournaments**: Weekend competitions throughout the school year
- **Analysis**: Reviewing rounds and identifying areas for improvement

The time investment is substantial, but the skills you develop will serve you well in college, career, and life.

## Getting Support

Don't hesitate to reach out for help:

- **Coaches**: Your primary mentors and strategists
- **Teammates**: Collaborate on research and practice together
- **Upperclassmen**: Learn from experienced debaters on your team
- **Online communities**: Connect with debaters from other schools and regions

## Getting Started

All successful debaters master the fundamentals covered in this unit before specializing. Whether you're drawn to the technical rigor of Policy, the philosophical depth of LD, the accessibility of PF, or the legislative simulation of Congress, you'll need strong skills in argumentation, evidence analysis, and persuasive speaking.

You're about to begin an incredible journey. The skills you develop in debate - critical thinking, research, public speaking, and rapid analysis - will benefit you far beyond high school.
