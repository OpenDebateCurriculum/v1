## The Four-Step Rebuttal

1) They say W
   - they say apples are more nutritional than oranges
2) Wrong
   - no
3) Because Y
   - oranges actually have more fiber than apples when you include the peels
4) Therefore Z
   - therefore oranges are better than apples

## Rebuttal Mechanics

### Defensive Rebuttals

Imagine your opponents make the following argument: If we send missile technology to Ukraine, Russia will nuke the United States. You might make the following arguments in response:

- The U.S. has sent missiles to Ukraine for three years without provoking this response, so it is unlikely that continued support will lead to nuclear conflict;
- Putin is a rational actor and will not attack the U.S. because of mutually assured destruction;
- Putin will attack us anyways because he is desperate;
- Or Putin does not have the capacity to attack the U.S. because of the Ukraine War.

What is the common thread between these arguments? All of them are defensive rebuttals. They explain why some action is unlikely to have the purported consequence based on past precedent, general trends, incentive structures, or simply capacity. The third rebuttal (that Putin will attack us anyways) functions a little bit differently than the other three because it does not deny the impact's likelihood, but it still attacks the causal link between the plan and the outcome. It attacks the argument's uniqueness, attempting to prove that the situation will happen regardless if the plan passes or not, removing the opponent's impact.

### Offensive Rebuttal

Take the same claims about Russia nuking the U.S.. An offensive rebuttal to this claim might be: if the U.S. sends more missile technology to Ukraine, it will show Putin that NATO is strong, deterring future conflict. An offensive rebuttal doesn't just negate a claim, it TURNS one on its head. These arguments will be particularly strategic in round, because opponents cannot simply "kick" scenarios that are turned.

We should be making a mix of offensive and defensive rebuttals in debate rounds.

## Labeling Rebuttals

1) Non-unique
   - You can attack uniqueness from two directions
     - the consequence is inevitable, or already happening (i.e. China is already on the brink of invading Taiwan)
     - the consequence will NEVER happen (i.e. China will not ever have the military capacity or will to invade Taiwan)
2) No link
   - attacks a plan's "solvency" (i.e. China won't care if the U.S. increases military presence in the Arctic)
3) Link turn
   - the plan will have the OPPOSITE effects (i.e. instead of deterring China, it will cause China to escalate)
4) Impact Defense:
   - mitigates the solvency, like a no link (i.e. climate change won't kill us all); these are way more effective in policy debate than PF, because policy judges buy existential impacts much more
5) Impact Turn
   - the plan will cause its intended impact, but that impact is bad (i.e. economic growth is not a good thing, becauseâ€¦)
6) One Note: do not link turn and impact turn and argument, or you've double turned yourself. If I say that their plan actually hinders economic growth AND that economic growth is horrible, then I've basically conceded that their plan is good.

**Drill:** we read a speech, or hand out a congressional bill, and ask students to make five strong arguments against it after adequate prep time.
