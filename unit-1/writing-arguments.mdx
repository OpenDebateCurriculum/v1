description: "Constructing compound arguments: advantages, disadvantages, and contentions"
---

Congressional bills, U.N. resolutions, affirmative plans, and contentions all fall under the umbrella of compound arguments.

## Types of Compound Arguments

1. **Bill:** a legislative proposal for the mock Congress
2. **Advantage**: in Policy and LD, the aff reads **advantages** that follow from their proposed plans.
3. **Disadvantage**: (a.k.a. disad): in Policy and LD, the neg reads **disadvantages** that follow from the proposed plan
4. **Contention**: in PF, there are no "advantages" or "disadvantages" because neither sides proposes a plan; we call each scenario a contention instead.

## The Three Components

There are three components to each compound argument:

1. **Uniqueness**:
   - We need a stronger foundation to understand the workings of uniqueness
     - **Harms:** the negative implications of the status quo (i.e. climate change)
       - *we sometimes say "squo" instead of status quo
     - **Inherency:** the structural, political, or practical barriers preventing the resolution of said harms
   - In LD and Policy Debate, the affirmative team's uniqueness encapsulates both harms and inherency. An advantage is non-unique if a. there are NO problems to solve; or b. some entity is resolving these problems in the status quo
   - In LD and Policy Debate, uniqueness functions similarly for the neg. A disad is nonunique if the consequences of the disad stem from the status quo, not just the aff.
     - **Example**: If you argue that patent law changes will clog courts with a flood of litigation, your uniqueness claim is that courts are *not* clogged right now. This sets up a contrast between the status quo and the post-fiat (post-doing-the-plan) world.
   - In PF, uniqueness is messy because neither side necessarily argues for a departure from the status quo. Uniqueness still matters, though.
     - **Example**: Your opponent argues that newly-implemented right-to-work laws crashed regional economies in 2008. You should point out that states without right to work law also flailed in 2008, so their claim is nonunique.
   - In Congressional Debate, a bill's preamble will establish harms and inherency: "whereas now…"

2. **Link:** connects the plan's action to a specific consequence.
   - If there is no link between the affirmative plan and its impact scenario, the aff has no **solvency**
   - The link functions similarly for the neg – and in PF and Congress
     - **Example**: A change in patent law will congest the court *because* people will sue more often if they're uncertain about what's patentable under the new rules.

3. **Impact:** why a plan/scenario matters.
   - **Example**: the plan prevents nuclear war and solves chemical pollution, etc.

**Exercize**: we're going to throw you into the deep-end here–write a bill following this format https://docs.google.com/document

1. You CAN use evidence, but it's not required.
2. Write about something interesting to you, or something not very interesting at all, or something funny, as long as you back it up
3. Your bill does not need to be as long as the samples.
