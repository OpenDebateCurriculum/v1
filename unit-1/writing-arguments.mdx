description: "Constructing compound arguments: advantages, disadvantages, and contentions"
---

Congressional bills, U.N. resolutions, affirmative plans, and contentions all fall under the umbrella of **compound arguments** - complex argumentative structures that combine multiple claims and warrants to make a comprehensive case.

## Types of Compound Arguments

### 1. Bill

A legislative proposal for mock Congress in Congressional Debate.

### 2. Advantage

In Policy and LD, the affirmative reads **advantages** that follow from their proposed plans.

### 3. Disadvantage (Disad)

In Policy and LD, the negative reads **disadvantages** that follow from the proposed plan.

### 4. Contention

In Public Forum, there are no "advantages" or "disadvantages" because neither side proposes a specific plan. Instead, we call each major argument a **contention**.

## The Three Components

Every compound argument has three essential parts:

### 1. Uniqueness

Understanding uniqueness requires grasping two foundational concepts:

#### Harms

The **negative implications of the status quo** (current situation).

- Example: Climate change is causing rising sea levels and extreme weather

#### Inherency

The **structural, political, or practical barriers** preventing resolution of these harms.

- Example: Political gridlock prevents climate legislation

**In Policy and LD**: The affirmative team's uniqueness encompasses both harms and inherency. An advantage is **non-unique** if:

- There are NO problems to solve, OR
- Some entity is already resolving these problems in the status quo

**For negative teams**: A disadvantage is **non-unique** if the consequences stem from the status quo, not just the affirmative plan.

**Example**: If you argue that patent law changes will flood courts with litigation, your uniqueness claim is that courts are _not_ currently flooded. This establishes contrast between the status quo and post-plan world.

**In Public Forum**: Uniqueness is complex because neither side necessarily argues for departure from the status quo, but it still matters.

**Example**: Your opponent argues that newly-implemented right-to-work laws crashed regional economies in 2008. You should point out that states without right-to-work laws also struggled in 2008, making their claim non-unique.

### 2. Link

**Connects the plan's action to a specific consequence.**

- If there's no link between the affirmative plan and its impact scenario, the aff has no **solvency**
- The link functions similarly for negative arguments and in PF/Congress

**Example**: A change in patent law will congest courts _because_ people will sue more often if they're uncertain about what's patentable under new rules.

### 3. Impact

**Why a plan/scenario matters** - the ultimate consequences.

**Example**: The plan prevents nuclear war and solves chemical pollution.

## Practice Exercise

Write a bill following [this format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8IaCwRvdElppQS7oQVR5bup2BDrfePKfWQILsbX2QQ/edit?usp=sharing):

### Guidelines:

1. You CAN use evidence, but it's not required
2. Write about something interesting to you - or something not very interesting, or even something funny - as long as you back it up with solid reasoning
3. Your bill doesn't need to be as long as professional samples

### Structure Your Argument:

- **Uniqueness**: What problems exist now? What prevents them from being solved?
- **Link**: How does your proposed action connect to solving these problems?
- **Impact**: Why should anyone care about solving this issue?

## Examples in Practice

### Climate Policy Advantage

- **Uniqueness**: Climate change is accelerating; current policies are insufficient to meet emission targets
- **Link**: Carbon pricing creates market incentives for clean technology adoption
- **Impact**: Avoiding climate catastrophe prevents ecosystem collapse and saves millions of lives

### Economic Disadvantage

- **Uniqueness**: The economy is currently stable with low unemployment
- **Link**: New regulations increase compliance costs for businesses
- **Impact**: Economic downturn leads to unemployment and social instability

## Common Mistakes

1. **Weak uniqueness**: Failing to establish clear contrast with status quo
2. **Missing links**: Jumping from plan to impact without explaining the causal chain
3. **Vague impacts**: Using generic consequences without specific warrants

## Next Steps

Once you can construct solid compound arguments, you need to learn how to attack them effectively. Continue to [Rebuttals](/unit-1/rebuttals) to master the art of refutation.

<Warning>
  Remember that compound arguments are only as strong as their weakest
  component. A devastating attack on any one element (uniqueness, link, or
  impact) can collapse your entire case.
