Every effective argument contains specific components that work together to persuade your audience. Understanding this structure is essential for both constructing your own arguments and analyzing your opponents'.

## The Anatomy of an Argument

### 1. Claim
An **unbacked assertion** - your main point or conclusion.

**Example**: "Apples are better than oranges."

### 2. Warrant
A **reason to buy the claim** - this includes both evidence and reasoning.

#### Evidence
**Information from reliable sources** that supports your claim.

**Example**: "The FDA finds that apples have 4.4g fiber per 100g; oranges have 2.4g fiber per 100g."

#### Reasoning  
**Why the evidence matters** - the logical connection between your evidence and claim.

**Example**: "Apples have higher fiber content than oranges, so they are better for human digestion; therefore, apples are better than oranges."

### 3. Implication
**Why your audience should care** - the broader significance of your argument.

**Example**: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away; transitioning from an orange-based diet to an apple-based one will help you live longer."

## The Importance of Implication

This apples-oranges example is silly, but implicating out your arguments really matters. Ten evidence-based claims are great, but a clear portrait of how two empirical claims interact with your opponents' arguments is far more likely to win you the round.

## Identifying Implicit Claims

Sometimes the claim is implicit in how you phrase your argument. Consider this sentence:

**"Xi will invade Taiwan because he wants access to semiconductors."**

- **Claim** (implicit): Xi will invade Taiwan
- **Warrant**: He wants access to semiconductors

## Minimum Requirements

Every argument should include **at the very least a claim and a warrant**. Without both components, you don't have a complete argument - you have either an unsupported assertion or irrelevant information.

## Practice Exercise

Identify the following as **claims**, **warrants**, or pieces of **evidence**:

1. Russia will nuke the U.S. if the U.S. increases its military presence in the Arctic, specifically near key shipping lanes like the Bering Straits.

2. mRNA vaccines will prevent deaths, as evidence from the COVID epidemic suggests.

3. Putin invades other countries to assuage Russian elites and to distract from Russia's economic instability.

4. Religious belief is not a prerequisite to morality.

5. I am a moral person and I am not religious, so the relationship between religion and morality mustn't be causal.

6. On balance, religion is beneficial because it incentivizes good behavior with promises of a paradisiacal after-life.

7. As conflicts in Nigeria, Myanmar, and Israel suggest, religious chasms will spiral into regional wars.

8. Recent 538 polls show that most Brits support reversing Brexit; they miss the passport-less travel and lower consumer prices.

9. The U.K. ought to reverse engineer Brexit to restore European unity, especially as Russia pushes westwards.

10. A weak and logistically-complex nuke-sharing apparatus between France and other European nations would invite deadly cyberattacks.

<Accordion title="Answer Key">
1. **Claim** - This is a predictive assertion about what will happen
2. **Warrant** - This provides reasoning with evidence reference  
3. **Warrant** - This explains Putin's motivations (reasoning)
4. **Claim** - This is an assertion about the relationship between religion and morality
5. **Warrant** - This provides personal evidence and reasoning to support claim #4
6. **Warrant** - This provides reasoning for why religion might be beneficial
7. **Evidence/Warrant** - This cites specific examples as evidence for a claim about religious conflict
8. **Evidence** - This cites polling data as factual support
9. **Claim** - This is a policy assertion about what the U.K. should do
10. **Warrant** - This provides reasoning about potential consequences

## Moving Forward

Now that you understand basic argument structure, you're ready to learn how to combine multiple arguments into more complex cases. Continue to [Writing Arguments](/unit-1/writing-arguments) to learn about compound arguments like advantages, disadvantages, and contentions.

<Tip>
As you practice, focus on making your warrants explicit. Judges can't fill in logical gaps for you - spell out exactly why your evidence supports your claim.
