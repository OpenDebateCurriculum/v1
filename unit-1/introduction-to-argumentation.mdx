## The Anatomy of an Argument

### 1. Claim
An **unbacked assertion**.

**Example**: "Apples are better than oranges."

### 2. Warrant
A **reason to buy the claim**.

#### Evidence
**Information from reliable sources**.

**Example**: "The FDA finds that apples have X% fiber content; oranges have Y% fiber content."

#### Reasoning  
**Why the evidence matters**.

**Example**: "Apples have a higher fiber content than oranges, so they are better for human digestion; therefore, apples are better than oranges."

### 3. Implication
**Why your audience should care**.

**Example**: "An apple a day keeps the doctors away; transitioning from an orange-based diet to an apple-based one will help you live longer."

This apples-oranges example is silly, but implicating out your arguments really matters. Ten evidence-based claims are great, but a clear portrait of how two empirical claims interact with your opponents' is far more likely to win you the round.

## Identifying Implicit Claims

Every argument should include at the very least a claim and a warrant. Sometimes the claim is implicit. Take the sentence "Xi will invade Taiwan because he wants access to semiconductors." The claim is highlighted in red, the warrant is highlighted in orange.

## Practice Exercise

**Exercise**: Identify the following as claims, warrants, or pieces of evidence:

1. Russia will nuke the U.S. if the U.S. increases its military presence in the Arctic, specifically near key shipping lanes like the Bering Straits.
2. mRNA vaccines will prevent deaths, as evidence from the COVID epidemic suggests
3. Putin invades other countries to assuage Russian elites and to distract from Russia's economic instability.
4. Religious belief is not a prerequisite to morality.
5. I am a moral person and I am not religious, so the relationship between religion and morality mustn't be causal.
6. On balance, religion is beneficial because it incentivizes good behavior with promises of an paridisiacal after-life.
7. As conflicts in Nigeria, Myanmar, and Israel suggest, religious chasms will spiral into regional wars.
8. Recent 538 polls show that most Brits support reversing Brexit; they miss the passport-less travel and lower consumer prices.
9. The U.K. ought to reverse engineer Brexit to restore European unity, especially as Russia pushes westwards
10. A weak and logistically-complex nuke-sharing apparatus between France and other European nations would invite deadly cyberattacks.
