Strong evidence forms the backbone of persuasive argumentation. Learning to find, evaluate, cut, and present evidence effectively will dramatically improve your debate performance.

## Finding Helpful Evidence

### Primary Sources

- **Government reports**: Congressional Budget Office, Department studies, agency data
- **Academic journals**: Peer-reviewed research from universities
- **Think tanks**: Brookings, Heritage Foundation, Council on Foreign Relations
- **International organizations**: UN reports, World Bank data, IMF analysis

### Secondary Sources

- **Quality journalism**: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post
- **Specialized publications**: Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, Nature
- **Expert commentary**: Op-eds by recognized authorities

### What to Look For

- **Statistics**: Quantitative data that supports your claims
- **Expert analysis**: Qualified opinions and predictions
- **Case studies**: Specific examples that prove broader points
- **Causal explanations**: Research explaining why things happen

## Cutting Cards

Many sources contain stylistic and superfluous words that don't communicate necessary information. **Card cutting** saves crucial speech time by extracting only essential content.

### Example of Cutting

**Original text**: "Many of the sources you will be pulling from will have stylistic and superfluous words that do not communicate any new or necessary information. Thus, this is why we cut cardsâ€” it saves crucial speech time."

**Cut version**: "...sources...have...superfluous words... thus... we cut cards..."

### Cutting Guidelines

**Do**:

- Preserve the author's meaning
- Keep essential qualifiers ("may," "likely," "suggests")
- Maintain logical flow
- Include relevant statistics and dates

**Don't**:

- Change the meaning through selective editing
- Remove important caveats or limitations
- Cut so aggressively that arguments become unclear
- Misrepresent uncertain claims as definitive

## Tagline Quality

Your **tagline** summarizes what the evidence proves. Strong taglines are:

### Specific

**Good**: "China's military modernization threatens Taiwan independence"
**Bad**: "China threat"

### Accurate

The tagline must match what the evidence actually says, not what you wish it said.

### Strategic

Frame the evidence in terms that help your argument and case strategy.

## Citation Quality

Proper citations establish credibility and allow verification.

### Required Elements

- **Author name and credentials**: "Dr. Sarah Johnson, Professor of International Relations at Harvard"
- **Source and date**: "Foreign Affairs, March 2024"
- **Relevant qualifications**: Why this person is an expert on this topic

### Credibility Indicators

- **Academic credentials**: PhD, university affiliation
- **Professional experience**: Former government officials, industry experts
- **Publication quality**: Peer-reviewed journals, respected newspapers
- **Recency**: Current information for evolving topics

## Evidence Ethics

### Academic Integrity

- Never fabricate quotes or sources
- Don't misrepresent what evidence says
- Cite sources accurately and completely
- Share evidence with opponents when requested

### Strategic Considerations

- **Quality over quantity**: One strong card beats three weak ones
- **Relevance**: Evidence must actually prove your claim
- **Context**: Understand the broader argument the author is making
- **Limitations**: Acknowledge what your evidence doesn't prove

## Evidence Length

### Constructive Speeches

Longer evidence (30-60 seconds) allows for:

- Detailed explanations
- Multiple supporting points
- Strong credibility establishment

### Rebuttal Speeches

Shorter evidence (10-20 seconds) enables:

- Rapid coverage of multiple arguments
- Quick refutation of opponent claims
- Efficient time management

## Card Cutting Drill

**Materials**: Recent articles on current debate topics
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Process**:

1. Select 2-3 articles on the same topic
2. Identify key arguments and evidence
3. Cut 5-6 cards with strategic taglines
4. Practice reading cards aloud for clarity

**Skills developed**:

- Source evaluation
- Efficient reading and extraction
- Strategic framing
- Oral presentation

## Common Evidence Mistakes

### Research Phase

- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeking evidence that supports predetermined views
- **Outdated sources**: Using old information for current topics
- **Poor source quality**: Relying on blogs, social media, or biased sources

### Cutting Phase

- **Over-cutting**: Removing so much that arguments become unclear
- **Under-cutting**: Including unnecessary words that waste speech time
- **Misrepresentation**: Changing meaning through selective editing

### Presentation Phase

- **Unclear taglines**: Vague or inaccurate summaries
- **Poor citation**: Missing credentials or source information
- **Monotone delivery**: Reading evidence without emphasis or clarity

## Digital Organization

### File Management

- **Consistent naming**: "Topic_Author_Date_Tag.docx"
- **Folder structure**: Organize by arguments, not just topics
- **Version control**: Track updates and revisions

### Citation Tracking

- **Source documents**: Keep original articles for reference
- **Citation database**: Spreadsheet with full source information
- **Quality ratings**: Note strength and relevance of each piece

Evidence research is time-intensive but essential. Quality evidence elevates every other aspect of your debate performance.

<Tip>
  Start building an evidence file early in the season. Even 15-20 minutes of
  daily research creates a substantial competitive advantage over time.
