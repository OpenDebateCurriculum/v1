## Unit 0: Learning, Teaching, and Contributing {#unit-0:-learning,-teaching,-and-contributing}

### 0.1 Start Here {#0.1-start-here}

Open Debate Curriculum is an open-source guide for teaching and learning high school debate. It’s primarily addressed to the debater (you).

The guide includes drills to supplement instruction. Users should try and share any derivative materials (i.e. video-based lessons, drills, etc.). With any luck, the best of these can be incorporated into the guide in-turn.

## Unit 1: The Foundations {#unit-1:-the-foundations}

### 1.1 The Activity {#1.1-the-activity}

All forms of high school debate are fundamentally “competitive speaking.” You and your opponent(s) will deliver a series of speeches in front of a judge, who will determine a winner. Tournaments are held on weekends at high schools and universities across the country. 

The most popular forms of debate are: 

- **Policy Debate:** the oldest and most rigorous form of debate; two debaters per team; each rounds lasts two hours; the affirmative team proposes a “plan;” the negation must prove that this plan is a bad idea.   
- **Lincoln-Douglas:** similar to Policy Debate, but 1v1, one-hour long, and more concerned with moral philosophy.   
- **Public Forum:** 2v2; each round lasts one hour; neither side really has a “plan”; you instead debate whether a given resolution is true or false.   
- **Congressional Debate**: debaters roleplay as policymakers; around fifteen students make speeches in support of or against mock bills (submitted prior to the tournament). 

This project will prepare you for all four types of debate—and for any spin-offs you encounter through high school (i.e. Big Questions, Ronald Reagan Debates, World Schools Debate, Parliamentary Debate, etc). It will employ some modified forms of debate (i.e. Extemporaneous Debate) for practice rounds, because their short speech times allow for honing in specific skills. 

Please do not hesitate to ask a coach or any older member of your high school’s debate team for more information about debate generally or about any of these individual events. 

### 1.2. Introduction to Argumentation  {#1.2.-introduction-to-argumentation}

1. **Claim**: an (unbacked) assertion,  
   1. i.e. apples are better than oranges.  
2. **Warrant:** a reason to buy the **claim**  
   1. **Evidence**: information from reliable sources   
      1. i.e. the FDA finds that apples have X% fiber content; oranges have Y% fiber content.  
   2. **Reasoning**: why the **evidence** matters  
      1. i.e. apples have a higher fiber content than oranges, so they are better for human digestion; therefore, apples are better than oranges.    
3. **Implication**: why your audience should care   
   1. i.e. an apple a day keeps the doctors away; transitioning from an orange-based diet to an apple-based one will help you live longer  
   2. This apples-oranges example is silly, but implicating out your arguments really matters. Ten evidence-based claims are great, but a clear portrait of how two empirical claims interact with your opponents’ is far more likely to win you the round. 

- Every argument should include at the very least a claim and a warrant. Sometimes the claim is implicit. Take the sentence “Xi will invade Taiwan because he wants access to semiconductors.” The claim is highlighted in red, the warrant is highlighted in orange. 

***Exercise***: identify the following as claims, warrants, or pieces of evidence  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Russia will nuke the U.S. if the U.S. increases its military presence in the Arctic, specifically near key shipping lanes like the Bering Straits.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_mRNA vaccines will prevent deaths, as evidence from the COVID epidemic suggests  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Putin invades other countries to assuage Russian elites and to distract from Russia’s economic instability.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Religious belief is not a prerequisite to morality.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_I am a moral person and I am not religious, so the relationship between religion and morality mustn’t be causal.   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_On balance, religion is beneficial because it incentivizes good behavior with promises of an paridisiacal after-life.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_As conflicts in Nigeria, Myanmar, and Israel suggest, religious chasms will spiral into regional wars.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Recent 538 polls show that most Brits support reversing Brexit; they miss the passport-less travel and lower consumer prices.    
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_The U.K. ought to reverse engineer Brexit to restore European unity, especially as Russia pushes westwards  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_A weak and logistically-complex nuke-sharing apparatus between France and other European nations would invite deadly cyberattacks. 

### 1.3 Writing Compound Arguments  {#1.3-writing-compound-arguments}

Congressional bills, U.N. resolutions, affirmative plans, and contentions all fall under the umbrella of compound arguments. 

1. **Bill:** a legislative proposal for the mock Congress  
2. **Advantage**: in Policy and LD, the aff reads **advantages** that follow from their proposed plans.   
3. **Disadvantage**: (a.k.a. disad): in Policy and LD, the neg reads **disadvantages** that follow from the proposed plan  
4. **Contention**: in PF, there are no “advantages” or “disadvantages” because neither sides proposes a plan; we call each scenario a contention instead.  

There are three components to each compound argument

1. **Uniqueness**:  
   1. We need a stronger foundation to understand the workings of uniqueness  
      1. **Harms:** the negative implications of the status quo (i.e. climate change)  
         1. \*we sometimes say “squo” instead of status quo  
      2. **Inherency:** the structural, political, or practical barriers preventing the resolution of said harms  
   2. In LD and Policy Debate, the affirmative team’s uniqueness encapsulates both harms and inherency. An advantage is non-unique if a. there are NO problems to solve; or b. some entity is resolving these problems in the status quo   
   3. In LD and Policy Debate, uniqueness functions similarly for the neg. A disad is nonunique if the consequences of the disad stem from the status quo, not just the aff.  
      1. **Example**: If you argue that patent law changes will clog courts with a flood of litigation, your uniqueness claim is that courts are *not* clogged right now. This sets up a contrast between the status quo and the post-fiat (post-doing-the-plan) world.  
   4. In PF, uniqueness is messy because neither side necessarily argues for a departure from the status quo. Uniqueness still matters, though.   
      1. **Example**: Your opponent argues that newly-implemented right-to-work laws crashed regional economies in 2008\. You should point out that states without right to work law also flailed in 2008, so their claim is nonunique.  
   5. In Congressional Debate, a bill’s preamble will establish harms and inherency: “whereas now…”  
2. **Link:** connects the plan's action to a specific consequence.  
   1. If there is no link between the affirmative plan and its impact scenario, the aff has no **solvency**  
   2. The link functions similarly for the neg – and in PF and Congress  
      1. **Example**: A change in patent law will congest the court *because* people will sue more often if they’re uncertain about what’s patentable under the new rules.  
1. **Impact:** why a plan/scenario matters.  
   1. **Example**: the plan prevents nuclear war and solves chemical pollution, etc. 

***Exercize***: we’re going to throw you into the deep-end here–write a bill following this format [https://docs.google.com/document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8IaCwRvdElppQS7oQVR5bup2BDrfePKfWQILsbX2QQ/edit?usp=sharing)

1. You CAN use evidence, but it’s not required.   
2. Write about something interesting to you, or something not very interesting at all, or something funny, as long as you back it up  
3. Your bill does not need to be as long as the samples. 

### 1.4 Formal Refutation {#1.4-formal-refutation}

1) The Four-Step Rebuttal  
   1) They say W  
      1) they say apples are more nutrititional than oranges  
   2) Wrong  
      1) no  
   3) Because Y  
      1) oranges actually have more fiber than apples when you include the peels  
   4) Therefore Z  
      1) therefore oranges are better than apples  
2) Rebuttal Mechanics  
   * Defensive Rebuttals  
     * Imagine your opponents make the following argument: If we send missile technology to Ukraine, Russia will nuke the United States. You might make the following arguments in response:  
       * The U.S. has sent missiles to Ukraine for three years without provoking this response, so it is unlikely that continued support will lead to nuclear conflict;  
       * Putin is a rational actor and will not attack the U.S. because of mutually assured destruction;   
       * Putin will attack us anyways because he is desperate;  
       * Or Putin does not have the capacity to attack the U.S. because of the Ukraine War.  
     * What is the common thread between these arguments? All of them are defensive rebuttals. They explain why some action is unlikely to have the purported consequence based on past precedent, general trends, incentive structures, or simply capacity. The third rebuttal (that Putin will attack us anyways) functions a little bit differently than the other three because it does not deny the impact’s likelihood, but it still attacks the causal link between the plan and the outcome. It attacks the argument’s uniqueness, attempting to prove that the situation will happen regardless if the plan passes or not, removing the opponent’s impact.  
   * Offensive Rebuttal  
     * Take the same claims about Russia nuking the U.S.. An offensive rebuttal to this claim might be: if the U.S. sends more missile technology to Ukraine, it will show Putin that NATO is strong, deterring future conflict. An offensive rebuttal doesn’t just negate a claim, it TURNS one on its head. These arguments will be particularly strategic in round, because opponents cannot simply “kick” scenarios that are turned.   
   * We should be making a mix of offensive and defensive rebuttals in debate rounds.   
3) Labeling Rebuttals  
   1) Non-unique  
      1) You can attack uniqueness from two directions  
         1) the consequence is inevitable, or already happening  (i.e. China is already on the brink of invading Taiwan)  
         2) the consequence will NEVER happen (i.e. China will not ever have the military capacity or will to invade Taiwan)  
   2) No link  
      1) attacks a plan’s “solvency” (i.e. China won’t care if the U.S. increases military presence in the Arctic)  
   3) Link turn  
      1) the plan will have the OPPOSITE effects (i.e. instead of deterring China, it will cause China to escalate)  
   4) Impact Defense:   
      1) mitigates the solvency, like a no link (i.e. climate change won’t kill us all); these are way more effective in policy debate than PF, because policy judges buy existential impacts much more  
   5) Impact Turn  
      1) the plan will cause its intended impact, but that impact is bad (i.e. economic growth is not a good thing, because…)  
   6) One Note: do not link turn and impact turn and argument, or you’ve double turned yourself. If I say that their plan actually hinders economic growth AND that economic growth is horrible, then I’ve basically conceded that their plan is good. 

***Drill:*** we read a speech, or hand out a congressional bill, and ask students to make five strong arguments against it after adequate prep time. 

### 1.5 Evidence (\* more emphasis \*) {#1.5-evidence-(*-more-emphasis-*)}

* Finding helpful statistics and warrants  
* Cutting cards  
  * Many of the sources you will be pulling from will have stylistic and superfluous words that do not communicate any new or necessary information. Thus, this is why we cut cards— it saves crucial speech time.   
    * Just look at the last two sentences, we can cut it easily to say: “…sources…have…superfluous words… thus… we cut cards…  
  * Tagline quality  
  * Length of evidence  
  * Citation quality  
* Evidence ethics  
* Drill: card cutting

### 2.2 Burdens of the AFF and NEG  {#2.2-burdens-of-the-aff-and-neg}

This subsection is specific to Policy, LD, and some plan-based PF topics. 

- The Aff has the following five burdens (the acronym SHITS might be helpful for memorization purposes):  
1. Inherency – proof that problem resolution is impossible in the status quo due to structural, political, or practical barriers  
2. Harms – proof that the status quo is detrimental in some way  
3. Significance – proof that the issue is important, and that the judge should care  
4. Solvency – proof that the plan actually leads to its intended outcome  
5. Topicality – proof that the aff falls under the resolution  
- Basically, the aff is losing at the start of the round; they have to prove something – traditionally, that something under the resolution is a good idea  
  - Prima facie – “at first appearance;” after the first speech, the judge should be very excited to vote for the presenting team (aff in Policy and LD)  
- The neg has the burden of rejoinder; it must disagree with the aff or prove the aff beyond the scope of the topic

### 2.3 Disad Dan {#2.3-disad-dan}

### 2.4 The Offense-Defense Paradigm {#2.4-the-offense-defense-paradigm}

- You derive offense from any of your advantages/contentions  
- You derive defense from any case responses that are not turns  
- You can’t win around off of defense alone unless it is terminal defense (you’ve proved that the aff does nothing) and you instruct the judge to presume neg  
  - Note: it’s not always so easy to win zero-risk of impact in policy

***Activity***: make them watch a pf round and judge it

### 2.5 Impact Calculus (“weighing”) {#2.5-impact-calculus-(“weighing”)}

- Impact Calc is how you will win \>90% of debate rounds; good weighing simplifies greatly the judge’s decision  
- Magnitude: a comparative of lives lost/destruction cause in one scenario to another  
- Probability: a comparative of the respective probabilities of two scenarios  
- Timeframe: a comparative of the urgency of both scenarios  
- A formula for impact significance might be: Impact \= (probability x magnitude)/(timeframe)  
- Meta-weighing  
  - Weighing weighing mechanism  
    - I.E. Magnitude comes before other metrics: it is our responsibility to save the most lives no matter what. Other metrics would justify stopping one certain death in the near future over solving climate change.  
    - I.E. Probability comes before other metrics: when we make decisions in real life, and when policymakers make decisions, they do internal cost-benefit analyses. They are willing to risk a tiny (i.e. .0000001%) chance of nuclear war for signficant gain.   
    - I.E. Timeframe comes first: anything else would justify solving scenarios that are decades or even centuries out, about which we can hardly make predictions and projections.   
- An even more powerful tool for judge instruction is the prerequisite. The basic logic of a prerequisite in debate is either that one impact will fast track another impact or make the other impact scenario unresolvable.     
  - On the link level  
    - Let’s say your opponent argues that right-to-work laws can help alleviate poverty. One strategic argument for you might be: right to work laws decimate union membership; without collective bargaining powers, companies will always abuse their employees and pay them terribly.  
      - You are arguing that there is a structural flaw with right to work laws, because union membership is a **prerequisite** to solving poverty  
  - On the impact level   
    - This one’s a bit more simple. If your impact scenario is climate change, and theirs is war, you might say: climate changes leads to massive food and resource shortages, which allows populists to assume power; that short-circuits war   
- Of the baseline weighing mechanisms, only time frame and probability arguments can kill prereqs

- There are other, less traditional, ways of weighing arguments. We call these **frameworks** for evaluating the round. Let’s define some terms.   
  - Utilitarianism (a.k.a. util) – actions are right if they benefit the majority  
  - Deontology – the action itself is more important than its consequences; the morality of an action follows universal laws (i.e. don’t steal)  
    - Question for you all: does the intent behind an action matter?   
  - Structural Violence – it is the judge’s task to resolve the social and institutional harms that prevent people from meeting their basic needs prior   
  - Really, any framework is viable, if you have a warrant. I could say that economic impacts (i.e. inflation) should never come first since the government always finds ways to solve back for economic harms. I could argue that the judge must prioritize the Global South because it is exploited and removed from the picture by economists.   
- We usually go for util, especially in public forum. There are a couple of ways to fend off other framework arguments.   
1. Util is the most predictable and fair framework because it accounts for EVERY consequence of the plan, not just a select few  
2. Structural violence (+ any other fw of the sort) fails; it allows one small instance of harm to permanently delay action; no policymaker would ever endorse this.   
3. Util is inevitable; when you, as judge, determine the best framework, you do a cost-benefit analysis of that framework’s utility in debate. Util must be inevitable if you default instinctively to util for meta-weighing. 

**Activity**: I Outweigh – a line of people take turns weighing a previous impact against theirs

### 2.6 Tech vs. Truth {#2.6-tech-vs.-truth}

- Tech (i.e. technical): a “tech judge” considers any argument true which is dropped or conceded (regardless of its truth)  
  - If your judge is an expert, ask questions post-RFD; you can get really good, intensive feedback  
- Truth: the judge will hold you to real-world arguments (I can’t say the sky is red)  
  - Many parent judges (called lay judges) will operate closer to this paradigm  
- You will encounter a variety of judges: your job is always just to convince them – don’t talk down to them 

***Unit Final:*** PF rounds

## Unit 3: Speaking Effectively {#unit-3:-speaking-effectively}

### 3.1 Cross Ex \+ Crossfire {#3.1-cross-ex-+-crossfire}

- Cross examination is 20% of every policy debate, even more of public forum; judges make decisions based on cross ex, especially if they are less experienced  
- Look for LOGICAL FALLACIES – we attach a chart here

### 3.2 Speaking Drills

- Giving a good speech, looking presentable, projecting, commanding the room, eye contact with the judge, NO long off-time roadmaps or countdowns

### 3.3 Speaking Drills {#3.3-speaking-drills}

Make them all do spreading drills in one room – wander around, and call them out individually to enunciate more and speak louder. 

* Enunciation: contort your mouth as much as possible to say each word   
* Watermelon Drill: interlace every word with a “watermelon”  
* Backwards: literally, read an article backwards  
* “Spreading” in debate: people read fast to get through more arguments. You do NOT need to spread, but speaking CLEARLY and FAST is certainly beneficial. 

Activity: give an example of GOOD spreading and BAD spreading. 

### 3.4 Word Economy

**Activity:** make them cut down a really wordy speech; improv, not saying more than what’s necessary

## Unit 4: Policy \+ LD {#unit-4:-policy-+-ld}

### 4.1 The Counterplan {#4.1-the-counterplan}

### 4.6 Other Theory Shells {#4.6-other-theory-shells}

### 4.7 Ks {#4.7-ks}

### 4.8 Answering Ks {#4.8-answering-ks}

Framework – this round is NOT just a debate about capitalism; you need to weigh the aff against a competitive alt OR you need to determine whether this is a good policy in the squo OR you need to determine whether the resolution is true  
Perm – why not do both? or just the K?  
Offense – actually, capitalism is GOOD, or security dialogue is GOOD  
Solvency – the K can’t solve the aff  
Theory – conditional Ks are bad  
Alt – transitioning away from capitalist will cause populist whiplash and wars  
Link – hey, we’re not that capitalist anyways

### 4.9 K affs \+ responses {#4.9-k-affs-+-responses}

### 4.10 Phil (for LD students) {#4.10-phil-(for-ld-students)}

## Unit 5: Circuit Debating {#unit-5:-circuit-debating}

### 5.1 Jargon {#5.1-jargon}

- Squo – status quo, the time being  
- T – topicality  
- K – kritik  
- Advantage – a positive outcome of the affirmative plan  
- DA/Disad – a negative outcome of the affirmative plan  
- Uniqueness –   
- Apriori – prior, but fancy  
- Lay \- like non-clerical people are called laymen, lay is used in debate to refer to judges who have little to no experience with debate. Most often parents.
