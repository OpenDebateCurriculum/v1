title: "Tech vs. Truth"
description: "Understanding different judging paradigms and adaptation strategies"
---

- Tech (i.e. technical): a "tech judge" considers any argument true which is dropped or conceded (regardless of its truth)
  - If your judge is an expert, ask questions post-RFD; you can get really good, intensive feedback
- Truth: the judge will hold you to real-world arguments (I can't say the sky is red)
  - Many parent judges (called lay judges) will operate closer to this paradigm
- You will encounter a variety of judges: your job is always just to convince themâ€”don't talk down to them
