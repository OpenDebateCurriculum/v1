description: "Understanding different judging paradigms and adaptation strategies"
---

Judges evaluate debates differently based on their experience and philosophy. Understanding these differences helps you adapt your strategy and arguments appropriately.

## Technical ("Tech") Judges

A **"tech judge"** considers any argument true if it is dropped or conceded, regardless of its real-world accuracy.

### Characteristics:

- **Flow-focused**: Tracks every argument systematically
- **Argument completeness**: Requires claim, warrant, and impact
- **Dropped arguments**: Treats conceded points as true
- **Evidence quality**: Values source credibility and recency
- **Complexity tolerance**: Can follow intricate argument interactions

### Strategy Adaptations:

- Cover all opponent arguments, even weak ones
- Provide complete argument structure (claim-warrant-impact)
- Use precise debate terminology
- Focus on technical execution over intuitive appeals
- Explicitly extend arguments across speeches

### Benefits of Tech Judges:

If your judge is experienced, ask detailed questions during post-round feedback. You can receive intensive, specific advice for improvement.

## Truth-Based Judges

**"Truth judges"** hold debaters to real-world standards and reject arguments that seem obviously false.

### Characteristics:

- **Common sense**: Apply real-world knowledge to evaluate claims
- **Reasonableness**: Reject extreme or implausible arguments
- **Accessibility**: Prefer clear, understandable arguments
- **Evidence skepticism**: Question dubious or outdated sources
- **Intuitive evaluation**: Trust gut reactions about argument quality

### Strategy Adaptations:

- Focus on realistic, credible arguments
- Explain why your position makes intuitive sense
- Use accessible language and examples
- Avoid extreme impact claims without strong evidence
- Appeal to shared values and common experiences

### Parent/Lay Judges:

Many parent judges operate closer to this paradigm. They bring life experience but may lack technical debate knowledge.

## Judge Adaptation Strategies

### Pre-Round Research

- **Paradigms**: Read judge philosophy statements when available
- **Experience level**: Check judge background (parent, former debater, coach)
- **Regional preferences**: Understand local judging norms
- **Previous feedback**: Ask teammates about prior experiences with judge

### In-Round Adaptation

- **Early assessment**: Gauge judge reactions to different argument types
- **Language adjustment**: Match complexity to judge experience
- **Argument selection**: Choose strategies appropriate for judge type
- **Explanation depth**: Provide more or less context based on judge needs

## The Spectrum Approach

Most judges fall somewhere between pure tech and pure truth. Successful debaters adapt to judges across this spectrum:

### Tech-Leaning Judges

- Appreciate technical precision
- Reward comprehensive coverage
- Value argument interaction analysis
- Expect debate-specific terminology

### Truth-Leaning Judges

- Prefer common-sense arguments
- Reward clear explanation
- Value real-world relevance
- Expect accessible communication

### Balanced Judges

- Want both technical skill and real-world grounding
- Appreciate well-reasoned arguments with solid evidence
- Expect clear organization and explanation
- Value strategic thinking within realistic parameters

## Universal Principles

Regardless of judge type:

### Respect

- Never talk down to judges
- Adapt your approach without condescension
- Appreciate different perspectives and experiences
- Learn from diverse judging styles

### Clarity

- Organize arguments clearly
- Signpost major transitions
- Explain complex concepts when necessary
- Maintain professional demeanor

### Conviction

- Believe in your arguments
- Speak with confidence and authority
- Make strong, clear claims
- Stand behind your evidence and reasoning

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Adaptation

- **Problem**: Completely changing strategy mid-round
- **Solution**: Make gradual adjustments based on judge feedback

### Judge Stereotyping

- **Problem**: Making assumptions based on appearance or background
- **Solution**: Focus on paradigm and experience, not demographics

### Inflexibility

- **Problem**: Using same approach regardless of judge
- **Solution**: Develop multiple presentation styles for different audiences

### Disrespect

- **Problem**: Showing frustration when judge doesn't appreciate your arguments
- **Solution**: Accept different evaluation standards professionally

Your job is always to convince the specific judge in front of you. Master both technical precision and accessible explanation to succeed with any judging paradigm.
