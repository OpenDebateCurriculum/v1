*[This section will be expanded with specific disadvantage strategies and examples]*

Disadvantages are the negative's primary offensive weapon in Policy and LD debate. A well-constructed disadvantage proves that the affirmative plan causes significant harm that outweighs any benefits.

## Coming Soon

This section will cover:
- Disadvantage structure and components
- Common disadvantage types (politics, economy, security)
- Link strategies and evidence requirements
- Impact calculus and comparison techniques

For now, refer to the compound arguments section in [Writing Arguments](/unit-1/writing-arguments) for basic disadvantage structure.
