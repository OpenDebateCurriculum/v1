# Disad Dan

**Disad Dan** is a helpful character for understanding disadvantage construction and strategy. Dan is a stickman with 100 lives who lives in a small cabin atop cliffs, battered by wind and rainfall, though he is prone to injury.

Through Dan's adventures, we can understand how disadvantages work:

- **Uniqueness**: Dan currently has 100 lives and lives safely in his cabin
- **Link**: The affirmative plan causes Dan to lose lives through various dangers
- **Impact**: When Dan runs out of lives, bad things happen to the world

## Disadvantage Basics

Disadvantages are the negative's primary offensive weapon in Policy and LD debate. A well-constructed disadvantage proves that the affirmative plan causes significant harm that outweighs any benefits.

Every disadvantage follows the same three-part structure as other compound arguments:

1. **Uniqueness**: The bad thing doesn't happen in the status quo
2. **Link**: The affirmative plan causes the bad thing to happen  
3. **Impact**: The bad thing that happens is really, really bad

## Common Disadvantage Types

### Politics Disadvantages
- **Uniqueness**: The current political situation is stable
- **Link**: The plan angers key political actors
- **Impact**: Political backlash prevents other important legislation

### Economic Disadvantages  
- **Uniqueness**: The economy is currently stable
- **Link**: The plan costs money or disrupts markets
- **Impact**: Economic collapse leads to unemployment and instability

### Security Disadvantages
- **Uniqueness**: Current security situation is stable
- **Link**: The plan signals weakness or provokes adversaries
- **Impact**: Military conflict or terrorism increases

## Strategic Considerations

When running disadvantages, consider:
- **Link quality**: Can you prove the plan actually causes your scenario?
- **Impact magnitude**: Is your impact big enough to outweigh affirmative advantages?
- **Uniqueness strength**: Can you prove the problem doesn't exist now?

## Coming Soon

This section will be expanded with:
- Detailed disadvantage construction techniques
- Evidence requirements and research strategies
- Advanced link strategies for different plan types
- Impact calculus and comparison methods

For now, refer to the compound arguments section in [Writing Arguments](/unit-1/writing-arguments) for basic disadvantage structure.
