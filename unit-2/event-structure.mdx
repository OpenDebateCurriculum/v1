Understanding the specific structure and timing of each debate format is crucial for strategic preparation and effective time management during rounds.

## Public Forum Debate

**Format**: 2v2 teams with 3 minutes prep time

| Speech          | Speaker           | Time  | Objective                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Constructive    | Team A, Speaker 1 | 4 min | Present your team's case                         |
| Constructive    | Team B, Speaker 1 | 4 min | Present opposing case                            |
| Crossfire       | A1, B1            | 3 min | Alternate asking and answering questions         |
| Rebuttal        | Team A, Speaker 2 | 4 min | Attack opposing case                             |
| Rebuttal        | Team B, Speaker 2 | 4 min | Defend your case and attack theirs               |
| Crossfire       | A2, B2            | 3 min | Second crossfire period                          |
| Summary         | Team A, Speaker 1 | 3 min | Defend case; crystallize main issues; weigh      |
| Summary         | Team B, Speaker 1 | 3 min | Crystallize main issues; weigh                   |

### PF Strategic Notes

- **Speaking order matters**: Later speakers have slight advantage in framing
- **Crossfire dynamics**: Balance between asking tough questions and avoiding looking aggressive
- **Summary-Final Focus consistency**: Arguments dropped in Summary cannot be revived in Final Focus
- **Grand Crossfire**: Often determines round outcome; practice managing multi-person discussion

## Lincoln-Douglas Debate

**Format**: 1v1 individual competition with prep time

| Speech                         | Speaker   | Time  | Objective                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Affirmative Constructive (AC)  | Aff       | 6 min | Present case (plan and value framework)   |
| Cross Examination              | Neg → Aff | 3 min | Negative questions affirmative about case |
| Negative Constructive (NC)     | Neg       | 7 min | Present case and attack affirmative       |
| Cross Examination              | Aff → Neg | 3 min | Affirmative questions negative            |
| 1st Affirmative Rebuttal (1AR) | Aff       | 4 min | Defend aff case and attack negative       |
| Negative Rebuttal (NR)         | Neg       | 6 min | Defend negative; crystallize round; weigh |
| 2nd Affirmative Rebuttal (2AR) | Aff       | 3 min | Final crystallization and weighing        |

### LD Strategic Notes

- **Time disadvantage**: Affirmative gets 13 minutes vs. Negative's 16 minutes
- **1AR challenge**: Hardest speech in debate - must cover everything in 4 minutes
- **Framework debate**: Often determines how other arguments are evaluated
- **CX strategy**: Use questions to set up arguments for later speeches

## Policy Debate

| Speech                     | Speaker | Time  | Objective                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1st Aff Constructive (1AC) | 1A      | 8 min | Present plan and advantages                   |
| Cross Ex                   | 2N → 1A | 3 min | 2N interrogates 1A about plan                 |
| 1st Neg Constructive (1NC) | 1N      | 8 min | Read off-case positions and on-case responses |
| Cross Ex                   | 1A → 1N | 3 min | 1A questions about offs and case responses    |
| 2nd Aff Constructive (2AC) | 2A      | 8 min | Defend aff and rebut negative positions       |
| Cross Ex                   | 1N → 2A | 3 min | 1N interrogates 2A                            |
| 2nd Neg Constructive (2NC) | 2N      | 8 min | Split with 1N; focus on key positions         |
| Cross Ex                   | 2A → 2N | 3 min | 2A interrogates 2N                            |
| 1st Neg Rebuttal (1NR)     | 1N      | 5 min | Continue 2NC strategy; weigh arguments        |
| 1st Aff Rebuttal (1AR)     | 1A      | 5 min | Answer the "block"; crystallize efficiently   |
| 2nd Neg Rebuttal (2NR)     | 2N      | 5 min | Paint picture; prevent 2AR from "lying"       |
| 2nd Aff Rebuttal (2AR)     | 2A      | 5 min | Final voting appeal; strategic "lying"        |

### Policy Strategic Notes

- **The Block**: 2NC + 1NR = 13 consecutive minutes for negative
- **1AR challenge**: Must efficiently answer 13 minutes of negative arguments in 5 minutes
- **Prep time strategy**: Save prep for crucial moments, especially before 1AR and 2NR
- **Partnership coordination**: Teams must strategically divide responsibilities

## Congressional Debate

**Format**: ~15 students in legislative simulation

### Session Structure

- **Presiding Officer**: Student moderator managing parliamentary procedure
- **Docket**: Pre-submitted bills and resolutions for debate
- **Speaking time**: Typically 3 minutes per speech
- **Questioning**: 1 minute of questions after each speech

### Speech Types

- **Authorship**: First speech on a bill (by the bill's author)
- **First Affirmative/Negative**: Opening arguments for each side
- **Later speeches**: Must introduce new arguments, not rehash previous points
- **Crystallization**: Later speeches that synthesize the debate

### Parliamentary Procedure

- **Recognition**: Speakers request recognition from Presiding Officer
- **Precedence**: Alternation between aff/neg; new speakers get priority
- **Motions**: Previous question, recess, etc.

## Strategic Time Management

### Prep Time Usage

- **Save for crucial moments**: Don't waste on easy speeches
- **Coordinate with partner**: In team events, manage prep collectively
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to be slightly unprepared than to give terrible speech

### Speech Pacing

- **Signposting**: Use clear organizational structure to help judges follow
- **Time allocation**: Spend most time on your strongest arguments
- **Flexibility**: Adjust strategy based on time remaining

### Cross-Examination Strategy

- **Question types**: Yes/no questions maintain control; open-ended can backfire
- **Setup**: Use CX to establish arguments for your speeches
- **Don't argue**: Ask questions, don't make speeches in CX time

## Tournament Logistics

### Preparation Between Rounds

- **Flowing**: Review and organize your notes from previous round
- **Strategy adjustment**: Adapt arguments based on judge feedback
- **Evidence updates**: Cut new cards if time permits
- **Mental preparation**: Stay focused and confident

### Judge Adaptation

- **Paradigm reading**: Understand judge preferences before round
- **Speed adjustment**: Adapt delivery to judge experience level
- **Argument selection**: Choose arguments appropriate for specific judge

Understanding these structural elements allows you to develop format-specific strategies and maximize your effectiveness within each event's unique constraints.

<Note>
  Tournament schedules are demanding. Develop routines for eating, hydrating,
  and mental preparation between rounds to maintain peak performance throughout
  the day.
