title: "The Offense-Defense Paradigm"
description: "Understanding how judges evaluate competing arguments and why offense matters"
---

- You derive offense from any of your advantages/contentions
- You derive defense from any case responses that are not turns
- You can't win around off of defense alone unless it is terminal defense (you've proved that the aff does nothing) and you instruct the judge to presume neg
  - Note: it's not always so easy to win zero-risk of impact in policy

**Activity**: make them watch a pf round and judge it
