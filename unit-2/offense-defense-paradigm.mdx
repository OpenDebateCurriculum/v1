description: "Understanding how judges evaluate competing arguments and why offense matters"
---

The **offense-defense paradigm** is a fundamental framework for understanding how judges evaluate debate rounds. Mastering this concept is essential for strategic argument selection and round evaluation.

## Defining Offense and Defense

### Offense

**Offense** consists of arguments that give you a positive reason to win the round. These are arguments that, if won, provide independent justification for your position.

**Sources of offense**:

- **Advantages/Contentions**: Positive outcomes from your position
- **Disadvantages**: Negative consequences of opponent's position
- **Turns**: Proving opponent's argument actually supports your side
- **Solvency deficits**: Proving opponents can't achieve their goals

### Defense

**Defense** consists of arguments that merely mitigate or reduce the strength of opponent arguments without providing positive reasons to vote for you.

**Types of defense**:

- **No link**: Attacking causal connections
- **Impact mitigation**: Reducing significance of consequences
- **Non-unique**: Proving consequences happen regardless
- **Alt causality**: Identifying other causes of the same outcome

## The Paradigm in Practice

### Why Offense Matters

Judges generally cannot vote for pure defense alone. Even if you successfully prove that all opponent arguments are wrong, you still need a positive reason why your position is correct.

**Example scenario**: In a Public Forum round about trade policy:

- **Defense only**: "Their economic collapse argument is wrong because..."
- **Offense**: "Our policy creates jobs AND their collapse argument is wrong because..."

### Risk Assessment

Judges evaluate arguments in terms of **risk** - the likelihood that each argument is true. The offense-defense paradigm helps judges weigh competing risks:

**High-risk offense vs. Low-risk defense**:

- Even if defense reduces opponent argument to 20% risk, your 60% risk of offense still outweighs

### Terminal Defense Exception

**Terminal defense** completely eliminates opponent arguments (reduces them to zero risk). This can substitute for offense by proving opponents have no viable path to victory.

**Requirements for terminal defense**:

- Must prove opponent achieves literally nothing
- Should instruct judge to "presume" for your side in absence of offense
- More effective in some formats (Policy) than others (Public Forum)

## Strategic Applications

### Argument Selection Priority

1. **Strong offense**: Arguments you're confident you can win
2. **Terminal defense**: Arguments that completely eliminate opponent offense
3. **Mitigating defense**: Arguments that reduce opponent offense
4. **Weak offense**: Arguments with low probability of success

### Time Allocation

Spend more time on:

- **Your strongest offense**: These arguments win you the round
- **Opponent's strongest offense**: These arguments lose you the round if undefended

Spend less time on:

- **Opponent's weak arguments**: Don't waste time on arguments that aren't round-winners
- **Your weak defense**: Focus on stronger responses

### Cross-Examination Strategy

Use questions to:

- **Set up your offense**: Get concessions that help your arguments
- **Identify weak links**: Find vulnerabilities in opponent offense for later exploitation
- **Force specificity**: Make opponents commit to claims you can attack

## Format-Specific Considerations

### Policy Debate

- **High offense tolerance**: Judges accept low-probability, high-magnitude impacts
- **Terminal defense rare**: Difficult to prove zero risk in complex policy scenarios
- **Multiple offs strategy**: Negatives run many arguments hoping some stick

### Public Forum

- **Moderate offense standards**: Arguments must be reasonable and probable
- **Defense more powerful**: Judges skeptical of extreme impact claims
- **Accessibility focus**: Arguments must make intuitive sense

### Lincoln-Douglas

- **Framework determines offense**: Value criterion establishes what counts as offense
- **Philosophical grounding**: Offense often derives from moral principles
- **Abstract impacts**: Less emphasis on empirical consequences

## Common Strategic Mistakes

### Over-Relying on Defense

**Problem**: Spending entire round attacking opponents without establishing your own offense
**Solution**: Always maintain at least one strong offensive argument

### Weak Offense Selection

**Problem**: Going for arguments you're unlikely to win
**Solution**: Honestly assess your evidence quality and argument strength

### Insufficient Impact Comparison

**Problem**: Failing to weigh your offense against opponent's offense
**Solution**: Explicitly compare magnitude, probability, and timeframe

### Dropping Key Defense

**Problem**: Ignoring opponent's strongest arguments to focus on weaker ones
**Solution**: Prioritize responses based on argument strength, not personal preference

## Practice Activity: Offense-Defense Analysis

**Materials**: Record a Public Forum final round
**Exercise**: Watch and identify:

1. What offensive arguments does each team establish?
2. Which defensive arguments are most effective?
3. How does the judge explain their decision in terms of offense and defense?
4. What would you have done differently strategically?

**Skills developed**:

- Strategic evaluation
- Judge perspective understanding
- Argument prioritization
- Round assessment

## Advanced Concepts

### Offense Generation

Sometimes you can **generate offense** from opponent arguments:

- **Link turns**: Their plan causes the opposite of their claimed benefit
- **Impact turns**: Their impact is actually good
- **Alt solvency**: You solve their advantages better than they do

### Defense Stacking

Multiple defensive arguments can combine to eliminate offense:

- 30% risk + 40% risk + 50% risk = Very low net risk
- Each defense argument reduces overall probability

### Offensive Defense

Some defensive arguments become offensive when combined with weighing:

- "Even if their argument is true, ours still outweighs because..."

Understanding the offense-defense paradigm helps you think strategically about argument selection, time allocation, and judge evaluation. This framework applies across all debate formats and skill levels.

<Warning>
  Don't neglect defense entirely in pursuit of offense. Strong defense can
  eliminate opponent's path to victory and make your offense decisive.
