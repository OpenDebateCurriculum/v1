**Impact calculus** is how you will win >90% of debate rounds. Good weighing greatly simplifies the judge's decision by providing clear criteria for evaluation.

## The Three Core Metrics

### Magnitude

A comparative assessment of lives lost or destruction caused in one scenario versus another.

**Example**: "Our climate advantage saves 2 billion lives from sea level rise, while their economic disadvantage affects at most 50 million jobs."

### Probability

A comparative assessment of the respective likelihood of competing scenarios.

**Example**: "Economic recession is historically cyclical and recoverable, but climate tipping points are irreversible once triggered."

### Timeframe

A comparative assessment of the urgency of both scenarios.

**Example**: "Climate impacts materialize within this decade, while their technological benefits won't emerge for 30 years."

## Impact Significance Formula

A useful framework for thinking about impact importance:

**Impact = (Probability ร Magnitude) รท Timeframe**

This formula helps you systematically compare competing scenarios, though real-world weighing is more nuanced than mathematical calculation.

## Meta-Weighing

Sometimes you need to weigh the weighing mechanisms themselves:

### Magnitude First

"It is our responsibility to save the most lives no matter what. Other metrics would justify stopping one certain death in the near future over solving climate change."

### Probability First

"When we make decisions in real life, and when policymakers make decisions, they do internal cost-benefit analyses. They are willing to risk a tiny (.0000001%) chance of nuclear war for significant gain."

### Timeframe First

"Anything else would justify solving scenarios that are decades or centuries out, about which we can hardly make predictions and projections."

## Prerequisites

An even more powerful tool for judge instruction is the **prerequisite argument**. The basic logic: one impact will either fast-track another impact or make the other impact scenario unresolvable.

### Link-Level Prerequisites

**Scenario**: Your opponent argues that right-to-work laws alleviate poverty.

**Your response**: "Right-to-work laws decimate union membership; without collective bargaining powers, companies will always abuse employees and pay them terribly. Union membership is a **prerequisite** to solving poverty."

### Impact-Level Prerequisites

**Scenario**: Your impact is climate change, theirs is war.

**Your response**: "Climate change leads to massive food and resource shortages, which allows populists to assume power; that short-circuits democratic decision-making and makes war inevitable. Environmental stability is a prerequisite to peace."

<Note>
  Of the baseline weighing mechanisms, only timeframe and probability arguments
  can effectively challenge prerequisites.

## Framework Arguments

Beyond traditional weighing, you can propose **frameworks** for evaluating the round:

### Utilitarianism (Util)

Actions are right if they benefit the majority. Focus on aggregate welfare and consequence-based evaluation.

### Deontology

The action itself matters more than consequences. Morality follows universal laws (e.g., "don't steal").

**Discussion question**: Does the intent behind an action matter?

### Structural Violence

The judge should prioritize resolving social and institutional harms that prevent people from meeting basic needs.

### Custom Frameworks

Any framework is viable if you have a warrant:

- "Economic impacts should never come first since governments always find ways to solve economic harms"
- "The judge must prioritize the Global South because it's exploited and ignored by traditional economic analysis"

## Defending Utilitarianism

We usually default to utilitarian evaluation, especially in Public Forum. Here's how to defend it:

1. **Predictability and fairness**: Util accounts for EVERY consequence of the plan, not just select few
2. **Structural violence fails**: It allows one small harm to permanently delay action; no policymaker would endorse this approach
3. **Util is inevitable**: When judges choose the best framework, they do cost-benefit analysis of that framework's utility. Util must be inevitable if you instinctively default to it for meta-weighing

## Practice Activities

### "I Outweigh" Exercise

- Format: Line of students take turns weighing their impact against the previous speaker's
- Skills developed: Quick comparative analysis, creative weighing arguments

### Impact Comparison Drill

**Materials**: Index cards with different impacts (no computers to avoid AI assistance)

**Format**:

- 5 minutes prep
- 1 minute speech
- 30 second cross-examination
- 1 minute response speech
- 30 second cross-examination
- 1 minute prep
- 1 minute rebuttal each
- 30 seconds prep
- 30 second final speech each

**Sample impacts**: Bee extinction, elephant conservation, panda preservation, spider biodiversity, sunflower agriculture, earthworm ecosystems, Aspen tree forests, California geological separation, tsunamis, endocrine disruption, hernias, Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, stock market collapse, cyber attacks, Chinese invasion of Taiwan, permafrost thaw

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Always weigh**: Don't assume judges will intuitively prefer your impacts
2. **Be specific**: Vague weighing ("our impact is bigger") is unconvincing
3. **Engage their arguments**: Explain why their weighing is wrong, not just why yours is right
4. **Layer your weighing**: Provide multiple reasons to prefer your impacts
5. **Crystallize early**: Begin weighing in constructive speeches, not just rebuttals

Impact calculus separates good debaters from great ones. Master this skill, and you'll find yourself winning rounds even when your evidence is weaker than your opponents'.

<Tip>
  Practice weighing with real-world policy examples. How do actual policymakers
  balance competing concerns? This will make your weighing more credible and
  sophisticated.
