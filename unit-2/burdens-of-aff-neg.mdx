title: "Burdens of the AFF and NEG"
description: "Understanding the strategic responsibilities of each side in Policy and LD debate"
---

In Policy and LD debate, each side has specific **burdens** (responsibilities) they must meet to win the round. Understanding these burdens is crucial for strategy development and round evaluation.

<Note>
This section applies specifically to Policy, LD, and plan-based Public Forum topics where one side proposes a specific change to the status quo.
</Note>

## The Affirmative's Five Burdens

The affirmative team starts each round at a disadvantage - they must prove that change is necessary and beneficial. Remember the acronym **SHITS** for the five affirmative burdens:

### 1. **S**ignificance  
Proof that the issue is important and that the judge should care about resolving it.

**Example**: "Climate change threatens to displace 200 million people by 2050, making this the defining challenge of our generation."

### 2. **H**arms
Proof that the status quo is detrimental in some specific, measurable way.

**Example**: "Current carbon emissions are accelerating toward irreversible tipping points that will trigger ecosystem collapse."

### 3. **I**nherency
Proof that problem resolution is impossible in the status quo due to structural, political, or practical barriers.

**Example**: "Congressional gridlock and fossil fuel lobbying prevent meaningful climate legislation in the status quo."

### 4. **T**opicality
Proof that the affirmative plan falls under the resolution and is a legitimate interpretation of the topic.

**Example**: On a topic about "substantially increasing investment in renewable energy," the aff must prove their plan constitutes such an increase.

### 5. **S**olvency
Proof that the plan actually leads to its intended outcomes and resolves the identified harms.

**Example**: "Carbon pricing creates market incentives that have reduced emissions by 40% in European countries that implemented similar policies."

## Prima Facie Requirement

**Prima facie** means "at first appearance." After the first affirmative speech, the judge should be excited to vote for the affirmative team. The 1AC must present a complete, compelling case that addresses all five burdens.

If the affirmative fails to establish prima facie case, they lose regardless of negative strategy.

## The Negative's Burden of Rejoinder

The negative has one primary burden: **rejoinder** - they must disagree with the affirmative or prove the affirmative is beyond the scope of the topic.

The negative can fulfill this burden through:

### Direct Refutation
Attacking any of the affirmative's five burdens:
- **Significance**: "Their impact is exaggerated"
- **Harms**: "The status quo is improving"  
- **Inherency**: "Change is already happening"
- **Topicality**: "Their plan doesn't fit the resolution"
- **Solvency**: "Their plan won't work"

### Disadvantages
Proving that the affirmative plan creates new problems that outweigh any benefits:
- **Uniqueness**: These problems don't exist now
- **Link**: The plan causes these problems
- **Impact**: These problems are significant

### Counterplans
Proposing alternative solutions that solve affirmative harms without causing disadvantages:
- **Competitiveness**: Can't do both the plan and counterplan
- **Solvency**: Counterplan resolves affirmative harms
- **Net benefits**: Counterplan avoids disadvantages

### Kritiks
Challenging fundamental assumptions underlying the affirmative approach:
- **Framework**: Alternative method for evaluating the round
- **Link**: Problems with affirmative methodology or assumptions
- **Alternative**: Different approach to the issue

## Strategic Implications

### For Affirmatives
1. **Comprehensive case construction**: Address all five burdens in first speech
2. **Impact emphasis**: Make judges care about your issues
3. **Solvency specificity**: Explain exactly how your plan works
4. **Defensive preparation**: Anticipate negative attacks on each burden

### For Negatives  
1. **Strategic focus**: You don't need to win everything, just enough to outweigh
2. **Burden shifting**: Make affirmatives prove their case, don't prove negatives
3. **Impact comparison**: Even if aff solves some problems, neg impacts could be worse
4. **Presumption**: If round is truly tied, judge should presume negative (status quo)

## Presumption

**Presumption** is the principle that judges should prefer the status quo when evidence is exactly balanced. Since the affirmative proposes change, they bear the burden of proving that change is beneficial.

In practice, presumption rarely decides rounds because debaters usually make clear arguments one way or another. However, understanding presumption helps explain why affirmatives must be more comprehensive in their case construction.

## Common Mistakes

### Affirmative Mistakes
- **Incomplete prima facie**: Failing to address all five burdens in 1AC
- **Weak solvency**: Vague explanation of how plan achieves benefits
- **Poor inherency**: Not explaining why status quo can't solve
- **Impact inflation**: Making unrealistic claims about significance

### Negative Mistakes
- **Overextension**: Trying to win every possible argument instead of focusing strategically
- **Weak links**: Disadvantages that don't clearly connect to affirmative plan
- **Contradictory positions**: Running arguments that contradict each other
- **Insufficient impact comparison**: Not explaining why negative arguments matter more

## Burden Analysis in Round

Throughout the debate, analyze whether each side is meeting their burdens:

### Judge Evaluation Questions
- Has the affirmative established a prima facie case?
- Is the negative providing meaningful clash on key issues?
- Which side better explains why their arguments matter more?
- Has either side clearly won their essential burdens?

Understanding burdens provides a strategic framework for constructing arguments, allocating time, and evaluating rounds. These concepts apply most directly to Policy and LD, but similar strategic thinking helps in all debate formats.

<Tip>
Practice flowing (taking notes) with burden analysis in mind. Mark which arguments address which burdens, and track which side is winning each element throughout the round.
