Open Debate Curriculum is an open-source guide for teaching and learning high school debate. It's primarily addressed to the debater (you).

The guide includes drills to supplement instruction. Users should try and share any derivative materials (i.e. video-based lessons, drills, etc.). With any luck, the best of these can be incorporated into the guide in-turn.
